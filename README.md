# Visual Studio Dark Scheme
A [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) colorscheme designed to look like the default Visual Studio Dark colorscheme.

## Manual Installation
1. Download the `visual-studio-dark.sublime-color-scheme` file.
2. Using the main menu navigate to `Preferences > Browse packages`.
3. Copy the `visual-studio-dark.sublime.color-scheme` file to `Packages/User/`.

## Additional Information
I would also advice replacing the default C syntax highlighting file with my own [custom one](https://github.com/aliawan01/SublimeTextC-SyntaxHighlighting)
if you want to get the same syntax highlighting as you saw in the screenshots above.

This will add the following features:
- Highlight struct usage
- Highlight enums
- Highlights structs being used as parameters
